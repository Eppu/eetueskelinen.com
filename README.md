This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Copy the sample `.env` files and fill in necessary information.

To get Spotify stats working you'll need to get a client ID, client secret and refresh token from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

New pages can be added by creating new files in the `pages/` directory.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on e.g. [http://localhost:3000/api/health](http://localhost:3000/api/health). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/health.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Generating tokens

TBD

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the official [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
