        <p>
          I'm currently based in Tampere, Finland, and have been working in the software industry since 2014. In my
          work, I have skills and experience spanning most aspects of design and engineering, allowing me to shepherd
          ideas from concept to mock, prototype, and ultimately, functional world-class end products.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm furiously passionate about understanding the big picture, the small details, and everything in between. I
          love to learn and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. Along with keeping my tech
          skills up to date, I'm also interested in psychology, philosophy and anthropology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my life outside of work, I find joy in making and playing music ü•Å, taking photos with film cameras üì∏ and
          hitting the open road on my motorcycle üèçÔ∏è.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2 className={`${playfairDisplay.className} md:text-3xl text-2xl font-light mb-2`}>On work</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my career I've gotten to work on tons of interesting business problems, lead remote teams, and
          collaborate with some of the most talented individuals in the industry. I've worked with clients ranging from
          small startups to large corporations across various industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing common with every project I've worked on has been the focus on the user. I believe there is no
          substitute for understanding the people who will use the products we build. After all, what's the purpose of
          building something if it fails to solve a problem for someone or doesn't resonate with their needs?
        </p>
        <p>
          The intersection of design and technology is where I feel most at home. I'm passionate about creating
          experiences that are intuitive, delightful and accessible. I'm all for championing the user, but also
          understand and consider the importance of the business side of things, as well as the technical aspects of
          building world-class software.
