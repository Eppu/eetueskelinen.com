          <p>
            After working in and around the software industry for around a decade, I've found my place (for now, at
            least) in bridging gaps somewhere between design, development and business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the years I've gathered skills and experience spanning most aspects of design and software
            engineering, allowing me to shepherd ideas from concept to mock, prototype, and ultimately, functional
            world-class end products.
          </p>
          <p>I'm furiously passionate about understanding the big picture, the small details, and the user.</p>
          <p>
            I love to learn and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. Along with keeping my
            tech skills up to date, I'm also interested in psychology, philosophy and anthropology.
          </p>
