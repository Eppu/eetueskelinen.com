# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in MDX format. MDX allows you to write JSX (React components) alongside Markdown content, making it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive blog posts.

## Markdown Features

MDX supports all the standard Markdown features, such as:

- Headings
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks

Here is an example of a code block in Markdown:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

function getMDXFiles(dir) {
  return fs.readdirSync(dir).filter((file) => path.extname(file) === ".mdx");
}
```

## JSX Components

In addition to Markdown, you can also include JSX components in your blog post. This allows you to add interactivity and dynamic content to your posts. For example, you can embed a YouTube video:

## Conclusion

MDX is a great choice for creating blog posts that combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. It provides a flexible and extensible way to create rich and interactive content.

Happy blogging!
