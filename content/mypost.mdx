summary: "This is a sample blog post written in MDX format."

MDX allows you to write JSX (React components) alongside Markdown content, making it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive blog posts.

This text is **in bold**, while this is _in italics_. You can also include [links](https://example.com) in your blog posts.

```jsx
.button {
  color: black;
  background-color: gray;
}

.button--primary {
  color: white;
  background-color: green;
}
```

> more quotes with a [link](https://example.com)

## Images

Here is an image embedded in the post with regular markdown syntax:

![Sample Image](/images/eetueskelinen-full.jpg)

Here's an image using the custom `next/image` component:

<Image
  alt={`A sample image with a custom component`}
  src={`/images/eetueskelinen-full.jpg`}
  width={3840 / 3}
  height={2160 / 3}
/>

## Markdown Features

MDX supports all the standard Markdown features, such as:

- Headings
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks

Here is an example of a code block in Markdown:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

function getMDXFiles(dir) {
  return fs.readdirSync(dir).filter((file) => path.extname(file) === ".mdx");
}
```

## JSX Components

In addition to Markdown, you can also include JSX components in your blog post. This allows you to add interactivity and dynamic content to your posts. For example, you can embed a YouTube video:

### This is a level 3 heading

It's only a matter of time before you can embed a YouTube video in your blog post:

```js
import YouTube from "react-youtube";
function YouTubeVideo() {
  const videoId = "dQw4w9WgXcQ"; // Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up
  return <YouTube videoId={videoId} />;
}
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a great choice for creating blog posts that combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. It provides a flexible and extensible way to create rich and interactive content.

Happy blogging!
